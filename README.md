# Comic Book Finder

> User story: Since I have a large comic book collection and I love comics, I'd like to be able to search for a comicbook, and find details on the story. It would be nice to see these comicc, and find other issues I've never heard of.

The Marvel Universe is vast. There is a treasure trove of series that include characters we know, and ones we have not discovered yet. Many times issues get set aside and forgotten, or a series concludes long after we have moved on. Finding comics with a search feature could spark further interest in reading.

# HOW TO USE

A user can search their favorite comics, and find that comic in the Marvel database. They can see some info on the book, like characters, creator, events, and if it is part of a series. The main goal is to find info and save the comic in a user account. Search through the home page for comic book titles and a results page will display the query.

# HOW IT WORKS

By adding Marvel's api I can import a wealth of info on comics in that universe. Combining tables to show characters and titles would allow me to create a database where a curious mind can check fo related issues and maybe catch something they missed initially.
